## Lessons Learned

This project helped me further understand testing using Postman additionally the relationship between, the repositories, controllers, service and service implementations. Like most weekend projects I feel like I am continuously building upon my base foundational knowledge learned throughout the week and putting it together over the weekend when charged with a project of my own. We will continue to build off of this project and I look forward to continuing to build my understanding of how each element contributes to building a full-stack application.
