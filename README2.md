## Lessons Learned

I struggled with this assignment. I clearly understood the requirements and I appreciated that this homework builds upon our homework from the previous week. I made adjustments to my database which required a bit of refactoring and adding code to allow for my Postman tests to pass again.

I feel confident in my understanding of CRUD operations, however, I do not feel confident in how to use Javascript to access the data and manipulate the DOM.

I plan to continue working on this assignment beyond the due date to take the time to better understand the learning objectives.
